# Introduction

This workflow will teach you how to set up [Google Forms](https://docs.google.com/forms/u/0/?tgif=d) survey with Likert `r Cite(myBib, "likert1932technique")` scale quesions, read the responses in to R and report on the results.

--

A Likert scale question asks people to respond to a series of statements in terms of the extent to which they agree with them.

```{r eg-data, include=FALSE}
df <- data.frame("Strongly disagree" = c("o","o","o","o"),
                 "Disagree" = c("o","o","o","o"),
                 "Neither agree nor disagree" = c("o","o","o","o"),
                 "Agree" = c("o","o","o","o"),
                 "Strongly agree" = c("o","o","o","o"),
                 row.names = c("Blue is a great colour",
                               "Green is a great colour",
                               "Purple is a great colour",
                               "Yellow is a great colour"),
                 check.names = F)
```

```{r eg-tab, echo=FALSE}
df %>% 
  knitr::kable(caption = "To what extent do you agree with the following:",
               escape = FALSE,
               align = "c") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "condensed"),
                font_size = 12) %>%
  column_spec(1:5, width = "3cm")
```

# Workflow | Ingredients

You will need:

* a google account
* R and RStudio

This workflow assumes you have a little familiarity with using these.

---
# Workflow | Steps

## Setting up the survey

Go to [Forms](https://docs.google.com/forms/u/0/?tgif=d) and start a new blank form.

# Workflow | Steps

## Setting up the survey

.pull-left[
Give your form a name - I used the name 'colours'.

Choose the style of question called 'Multiple choice grid'
]
.pull-right[
![google form called colours showing question style menu and with Multiple choice grid selected](pics/gform_question.png)

# Workflow | Steps

## Setting up the survey

.pull-left[
Add your answer options as Columns. For example:
* Strongly disagree
* Disagree
* Neither agree nor disagree
* Agree
* Strongly agree

Add your statements as Rows. For example:
* Blue is a great colour
* Green is a great colour
* Purple is a great colour
* Yellow is a great colour

# Workflow | Steps

## Getting ready in R

You will need these packages:

* `googlesheets` `r Cite(myBib, "bryan_and_zhoa")`
* `likert` `r Cite(myBib, "Bryer_and_Speerschneider")`

Install these as follows:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("googlesheets")
install.packages("likert")
```

Then load them into R for use:

```{r}
library(googlesheets)
library(likert)
```
